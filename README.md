## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is **MatÄ›j Prudil** and I am a PhD student in the field of Building Materials. In my dissertation, I focus on automating the measurement of air pores in microscopic images of concrete using convolutional neural networks. I work for Coral Construction Technologies, where I deal with the composition of 3D-printed concrete, quality control, and the useful properties of the final prints.
